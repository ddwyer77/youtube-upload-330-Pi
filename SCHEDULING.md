# YouTube Shorts Upload Bot - Scheduling Feature

The scheduling feature allows you to upload multiple videos at specified time intervals, automating the process of uploading shorts to YouTube. This document explains how to use this feature.

## Using the Scheduling Tab in the UI

1. **Access the Schedule Tab**:
   - Launch the YouTube Shorts Uploader application
   - Click on the "Schedule" button in the left sidebar, or select "Schedule" from the View menu

2. **Schedule Videos from a Folder**:

   a. **Select Account**:
      - Choose the YouTube account you want to use for uploads from the dropdown
      - Make sure the account is authenticated (if not, go to the Accounts tab first)

   b. **Select Video Folder**:
      - Click the "Browse..." button
      - Navigate to and select a folder containing video files
      - Supported formats include MP4, MOV, AVI, and MKV

   c. **Set Upload Schedule**:
      - Specify how often videos should be uploaded (in hours)
      - Set the start time for the first upload
      - Default is to start in a few minutes and upload every hour

   d. **Import and Schedule**:
      - Click the "Import and Schedule" button
      - The application will:
        - Scan the folder for video files
        - Generate titles using OpenAI (if enabled)
        - Schedule videos at the specified intervals
        - Start the scheduler process in the background

3. **Managing Scheduled Uploads**:

   a. **View Schedule**:
      - The table shows all scheduled videos
      - Columns include: Title, Account, Scheduled Time, Status, Video ID, and Actions

   b. **Cancel Uploads**:
      - Click the "Cancel" button next to a pending upload to remove it from the schedule
      - Uploads that have already completed cannot be cancelled

   c. **Refresh Schedule**:
      - Click the "Refresh Schedule" button to update the display

## Using the Command-Line Tool

For advanced users or those who prefer the command line, there's a test script `test_schedule.py` that provides similar functionality:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
source fresh_env/bin/activate

# Run the test script
python test_schedule.py
```

The script will:

1. List available YouTube accounts
2. Prompt you to select which account to use
3. Ask for a folder containing videos
4. Let you specify the upload interval and start time
5. Schedule the uploads and display the list of scheduled videos

While running, you can:
- Check the status of scheduled uploads
- Cancel specific uploads
- Exit the script (the scheduler will continue running)

Example session:

## How the Scheduler Works

1. **Background Process**:
   - The scheduler runs in a background thread
   - It continues to run even if you close the application (as long as your computer is on)
   - Scheduled uploads will occur at their designated times

2. **Storage**:
   - Schedule information is stored in `~/.youtube_shorts_uploader/schedule.json`
   - This ensures persistence between application restarts

3. **Metadata Generation**:
   - Each video has metadata (title, description, tags) generated by OpenAI
   - This happens at the time of importing, not at upload time

4. **Authentication**:
   - The scheduler uses the stored credentials for each account
   - If credentials expire, the upload may fail
   - It's recommended to test uploads with each account before scheduling many videos

## Troubleshooting

- **Videos Not Uploading**: Check if the account is properly authenticated in the Accounts tab
- **Missing Videos**: Make sure the video files haven't been moved or deleted since scheduling
- **API Errors**: Check the logs for detailed error messages (`~/.youtube_shorts_uploader/logs/`)
- **Schedule Disappears**: Verify that your schedule file hasn't been corrupted or deleted

## Limitations

- The scheduler requires your computer to be running at the scheduled upload times
- For very large videos or slow connections, uploads may take longer than expected
- YouTube has daily upload limits that may affect scheduled uploads
- The maximum number of scheduled videos is not limited, but very large schedules may impact performance
